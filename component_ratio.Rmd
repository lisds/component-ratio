```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
pd.set_option('mode.copy_on_write', True)
```

```{python}
df = pd.read_csv('freelist_responses.csv')
df
```

```{python}
# Get the numerical data only.
responses = df.loc[:, 'Worms':]
responses
```

```{python}
# Subtract the mean from each column.
mc_resps = responses - responses.mean()
mc_resps
```

```{python}
# Confirm that all columns do now have (near as dammit) zero mean.
mc_resps.mean()
```

```{python}
# We now do "singular value decomposition".  This implements
# principal component analysis (PCA).
U, S, Vt = np.linalg.svd(mc_resps.T, full_matrices=False)
```

```{python}
# The "singular values" give the weighting for each component:
S
```

```{python}
# Now, let's divide the first component by all subsequent,
# to get the ratios of the first to the rest:
S[0] / S[1:]
```

```{python}
# Now do the same calculation in one shot:
def component_ratios(responses):
    """ Get ratio of first to subsequent PCA component weightings.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    responses : array or data frame
        2D array or data frame with numerical responses.
        
    Returns
    -------
    R : PCA component ratios
        Calculate PCA component weightings, and return ratio of
        first component to all subsequent components.
    """
    # Subtract the mean from each column.
    mc = responses - responses.mean()
    # Do singular value decomposition to implement PCA
    U, S, Vt = np.linalg.svd(mc_resps.T, full_matrices=False)
    # The component weights are in the 1D array S.
    return S[0] / S[1:]  # Ratio of first to all subsequent.
```

```{python}
# This calculation is the same as that above, just using
# the function - to confirm we get the same answer.
component_ratios = component_ratios(responses)
component_ratios
